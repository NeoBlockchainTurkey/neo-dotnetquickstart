The NEP5 spec (https://github.com/neo-project/proposals/blob/master/nep-5.mediawiki) states that there are to be a Required method and a Required event both called transfer. This isn't allowed in C#.NEO.

Is this an error/bug in the specification? Is there a specification that is more current/up-to-date?

NEP5: Do the required methods have to be declared `public` per the current specification? #32

The NEP5 spec (https://github.com/neo-project/proposals/blob/master/nep-5.mediawiki) states that there is a Required and Optional set of methods that need to be implemented and that they need to be declared public. Is this spec up-to-date? For example, the referenced example https://github.com/lllwvlvwlll/Woolong/blob/master/Woolong/Woolong.cs, declares these methods as private. Is there a specification that is more current/up-to-date?
